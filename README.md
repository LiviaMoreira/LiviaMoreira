# 👋 Hey there, I'm Livia!

## 🚀 About Me

📊 **Data Whisperer**: With over a decade in People Analytics, I'm on a mission to decode the mysteries of employee behavior using the magic of data! I turn numbers into stories and dashboards into visual masterpieces that even your grandma would understand.

🎤 **Storyteller**: Armed with exceptional communication skills, I don't just speak data, I make it sing! From executives to team leaders, I'm the translator who turns complex analytics into everyday insights.

🤝 **Bridge Builder**: I'm passionate about bridging the worlds of HR and Data Analytics. Imagine a world where HR decisions are as data-driven as your morning coffee choices.

## 📈 From People Analytics to Data Mastery

🎓 **Educational Leap**: I graduated from a rigorous Data Management and Analytics program, which has expanded my toolkit with advanced technologies including relational database systems, data warehousing, and visual analytics.

## 🎸 Rocking Out in My Free Time

🎵 **Bass Player Extraordinaire**: When I'm not crunching numbers or diving into data, you'll often find me jamming on my bass guitar.

🎸 **Life's Rhythm**: Playing bass has taught me the importance of rhythm and timing—not just in music but also in life and work. It's all about finding the right groove and knowing when to step forward and when to hold back.

🎤 **Jam Sessions & Jams**: I love connecting with fellow musicians and exploring different genres and styles. Dive deeper into my musical world and see what I'm up to by visiting my [Bandmix profile](https://www.bandmix.ca/livia-moreira).
